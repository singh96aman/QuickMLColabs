# üéâ Welcome to QuickMLColabs! üöÄ

Are you an aspiring ML engineer eager to dive into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning? Look no further! QuickMLColabs is your ultimate starting point, packed with ready-to-use Google Colab notebooks designed to help you quickly jumpstart your projects. 

## About Me and Why Me ?

I'm an `SDE-2 ML at Amazon US` with a passion for machine learning that spans over three years in the industry and two years of research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bPY9Z4YAAAAJ&hl=en)). Throughout my journey, I‚Äôve often been asked by fellow engineers how to `kickstart` their ML careers. This repository is my answer‚Äîan initiative to reverse-engineer real-world challenges and demonstrate how machine learning can be harnessed to solve them.

## Why This Repo?

- **Not Just Another Course**: While there are countless courses available that equip you with theoretical knowledge, this repo is all about practical, hands-on experience. Dive into real problems and see how ML can be applied effectively!

- **Jumpstarter Templates**: Think of these as your project launchpads! These reusable frameworks are designed to help you build and scale your ML projects efficiently, saving you time and effort as you innovate.

- **LLMs as a Resource, Not the Answer**: Like many, I‚Äôve wondered if LLMs can completely solve these problems. The answer is: they might, but these notebooks offer a deeper dive into problem statements, tools, and model choices, with data access and easy replication in Google Colab. The hands-on approach here outweighs the quick fixes of LLM-generated responses!
